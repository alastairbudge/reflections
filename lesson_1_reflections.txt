How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped because I wouldn't have easily been able to see it otherwise. Git helped me locate it immediately.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It allows you to go back and view how your code has changed over a period of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

it could mean that you forget to commit when you should, and it then becomes dificult to check out where a bug was made.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It's important to see how different files work together, as some properties might apply over multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

use the log to see what changes were committed. use diff to see the difference.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You know that you can always go back and track down bugs, so it doesn't really matter that much.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git because I've made mistakes in the past, and I want to be able to code effectively. I know that git is vital for this.
